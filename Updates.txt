Updates in this version:
* Solved this timing issue thing which caused the program to crash.
* Broke the program. It gets stuck more often now. :(


Previous updates:
* A simple TCP connection is created along with the VNC connection.
* The server's run can now be stopped and restarted safely using the "Stop Server" button.
* The server can now be closed before a connection was made without an exception being thrown (or rather, without an uncaught exception).
